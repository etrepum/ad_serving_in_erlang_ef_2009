What's MochiAds?
================

:MochiAds:

* Monetization platform for Flash game ecosystem
* Advertising solution for game developers
* Revenue share and distribution for publishers


Road to Erlang
==============

:MochiBot:

* (Originally) Python w/ Twisted
* Fast, but not fast enough (CPU bound)
* Wanted easy multi-node distribution


Previous Experience
===================

:Python:

* Non-blocking sockets are tedious
* Threads are too heavy

:C/C++:

* Too low-level


Why Erlang?
===========

* Performance
* Concurrency
* Distribution
* Fault Tolerance


(Bad) Benchmarks
================

ab -c 50 -n 10000 localhost

* Apache: 1x
* Twisted: 1.12x
* mochiweb: 2.5x
* nginx: 3.9x


Erlang at Mochi Media
=====================

MochiAds, MochiBot

* High-performance HTTP servers
* Ad targeting
* Real-time analytics
* Social gaming
* Lots of internal use


MochiAds Service
================

* Front-end
* Data warehouse
* Ad server


What's Not Erlang
=================

:Front-end:

* Python and PostgreSQL

:Data warehouse:

* Python and Vertica


Ad Serving Platform
===================

* Juniper Routers
* Cisco Switches
* OpenBSD load balancer
* Nginx HTTP load balancer (Linux)
* Erlang/OTP R12B-3 (Linux)


Ad Server Stack
===============

* Erlang/OTP R12B-3
* mochiweb (http)
* egeoip (geolocation)
* eswf (SWF file format)


Ad Server
=========

* Gather information about client
* Choose an ad
* Log impression data
* Log click data, redirection


Gathering Client Info
=====================

* Mostly client-side Flash code
* SharedObject (like cookies)
* Feeds targeting decisions for ad choice


Choose an ad
============

* Fold over in-memory data structure
* Filter out ads that don't match targeting info
* Weight the rest
* Choose a random number; 0 <= N < sum(Weights)


Log impression data
===================

* Validation
* Stream to hourly disk log
* Increment counters in RAM db


Log click data
==============

* Validation
* Stream to hourly disk log
* Increment counters in RAM db
* Redirect (HTTP 302) to destination URL


Cheap Tricks
============

* Ad request data in URL
* Long-term state in SharedObject


Short-term Feedback Loop
========================

* Client state
* RAM db counters from previous serves that day


Analytics Feedback Loop
=======================

* ETL processes adjust per hour
* Campaign weights, budget adjustments, etc.


Lessons Learned (part 1)
========================

* Network partitioning sucks
* Network partitioning sucks
* Network partitioning sucks


Lessons Learned (part 2)
========================

* pg2 is broken
* mnesia is too slow (for us)
* Inter-node distribution protocol can be flaky
* Erlang open source not always robust
* Lists are not a good data type for strings


Favorite Erlang Features
========================

* Module reloading
* Pattern matching
* Binaries
* Lightweight processes
* Concise but not cryptic


More Erlang at Mochi Media
==========================

* MochiBot
* MochiCrypt
* MochiScore
* IRC bot
* SVN deployment
* Monitoring system
* Node discovery
